			<header>What is GreenConnect?</header>
			The main purpose which served as the inspiration in providing us
			with this specific idea was the initial weeks we spent thinking
			where we were going to pursue our higher studies and which degree we
			were going to pursue before we enrolled ourselves into NSBM Green
			University.
			<br /><br />
			This website was developed for freshers and future students to gain
			insight on different degree programs and to communicate with senior
			students, lecturers and industrial experts as a helping hand for
			them to choose the ideal degree program and career path.
